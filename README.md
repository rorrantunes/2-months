## 💖 Emotional Pentesting Simulation

This project is a small mix of **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

It’s an **emotional pentesting simulation** made as a gift for my boyfriend 💕  
He’s a **Cybersecurity Engineering student**, passionate about his career, so I wanted to create something fun and meaningful for him.

This project was built to celebrate our **2-month anniversary** 🥰  
A mix of love, code, and a little hacker vibe.
